# SpaceX frontend application

Here is my objective : see quickly and easily few informations from [SpaceX API](https://docs.spacexdata.com/#bc65ba60-decf-4289-bb04-4ca9df01b9c1)

## How it works

Follow this steps to setup or launch the project

### Install all dependencies

Install all dependancies with `yarn install --frozen-lockfile`

### With docker

#### `docker-compose up -d`

Runs the app in the development mode by default.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

*Use `-d` if you want to detach the container from your terminal*

### Without Docker

#### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode by default.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### Others commands

#### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

#### `yarn run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
The app is ready to be deployed!
